# Angular Portfolio WebApp
This repo contains the side project of my portfolio WebApp which I will develop using the Angular framework
And, later, adding three.js to enhance UI/UX.

This was intended to be a frontend only application without the need of a backend server.
However, the integration of a 'Contact Me' functionality required a backend able to call a mailing API.

The web app is deployed and hosted in [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com) which is offering also a Continuous Deployment environment linked with the GitHub repo of the project.

Vercel is also allowing some 'backend' envinronment called Statelss Functions, thanks to this functionality, the webApp can integrate advanced features such as the 'Contact Me' mailing service.

Here you can find a high-level design of the solution:
